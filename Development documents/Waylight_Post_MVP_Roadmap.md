# Waylight Post-MVP Development Roadmap

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: September 2025
**Status**: Alpha-Ready → Enhancement Phase
**Developer**: Solo Developer MVP Scope

---

## Executive Summary

Waylight has successfully completed its MVP phase and is alpha-ready for November 2025 Disney World testing. This roadmap outlines the strategic development priorities for enhancing the app's core trip planning experience while maintaining focus on Walt Disney World and avoiding scope creep.

**Key Principle**: Build on existing strong foundations rather than adding completely new systems.

- **Collaboration**: Full trip sharing with role-based permissions already functional
- **Core Features**: Advanced trip planning, activity preferences, day type management
- **Architecture**: Robust web platform with offline-first design

### 🎯 **Key Strengths to Build Upon**
- Activity rating system with group consensus
- Sophisticated trip structure with park day selections
- Rich preference data from user interactions
- Proven collaboration infrastructure
- Strong web platform performance

- Meaningful empty state messaging
- Offline capability indicators

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
interface UXEnhancements {
  generateOnboardingFlow(userType: 'first-time' | 'returning' | 'expert'): OnboardingStep[];
  optimizeSearchResults(query: string, filters: Filter[]): SearchResult[];
  trackPerformanceMetrics(): PerformanceReport;
}
```

### 🧠 **4. Enhanced Recommendation Engine**
**Status**: Enhancement of Existing Systems
**Build on**: Current activity preferences and rating system

**Intelligent Suggestions:**
- Dynamic tip prioritization based on user behavior
