  // Actions
  createTrip: (trip: Trip) => void;
  updateItinerary: (dayId: string, items: ItineraryItem[]) => void;
  toggleTips: (enabled: boolean) => void;
}
```

### Offline Storage Strategy

db.version(1).stores({
  trips: 'id, name, startDate',
  attractions: 'id, parkId, name',
  settings: 'key'
});
```

### Component Architecture

│   ├── Card/
│   └── Modal/
├── trip/
│   ├── TripList/
│   ├── TripBuilder/
│   └── DayPlanner/
