## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Zustand store example
interface AppState {
  trips: Trip[];
  currentTrip: Trip | null;
  attractions: Attraction[];
  settings: Settings;
  
  // Actions
  createTrip: (trip: Trip) => void;
  updateItinerary: (dayId: string, items: ItineraryItem[]) => void;
  toggleTips: (enabled: boolean) => void;
}
```

### Offline Storage Strategy
```typescript
// Dexie schema for web
const db = new Dexie('WaylightDB');
db.version(1).stores({
  trips: 'id, name, startDate',
  attractions: 'id, parkId, name',
  settings: 'key'
});
```

### Component Architecture
```
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ common/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Card/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Modal/
â”œâ”€â”€ trip/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TripList/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TripBuilder/
