### 5. Offline Functionality Testing ✅

#### 5.1 Data Persistence
**Test**: AsyncStorage integration works properly
- [ ] Create a trip, close app completely
- [ ] Reopen app - trip should still exist
- [ ] Add attractions to trip, close app
- [ ] Reopen app - attractions should persist
- [ ] All user data survives app restarts

#### 5.2 Offline Operation
**Test**: App works without internet connection
- [ ] Disable WiFi/cellular data
- [ ] App should still function for:
  - Viewing created trips
  - Browsing pre-loaded attractions
  - Managing itineraries
- [ ] Re-enable internet - app continues working normally

**Expected Result**: Full offline capability with persistent data.

## Performance & Battery Testing

### 6.1 Battery Usage
**Test**: App doesn't drain battery excessively
- [ ] Use app for 30+ minutes continuously
- [ ] Monitor battery usage in device settings
- [ ] Battery drain should be reasonable for active usage

### 6.2 Memory Usage
**Test**: No memory leaks or excessive usage
- [ ] Use app extensively (create trips, browse attractions)
- [ ] Check device memory usage
- [ ] App should not consume excessive RAM

---

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### 7.1 Network Issues

   - Create new trip
   - Browse attractions
   - Add multiple attractions to different days
   - Edit trip details
   - View complete itinerary

2. **Data Management Workflow**:
   - Create multiple trips
   - Switch between trips
   - Delete unwanted trips
   - Verify data persistence

---

## Known Limitations & Notes

### Development Environment
- **iOS Simulator**: Requires macOS with Xcode (not available on Windows)
- **Android Emulator**: Requires Android SDK setup
- **Primary Testing**: Via Expo Go on real devices

### Package Version Warning
- React Native version (0.73.2) is slightly behind expected (0.73.6)
- App functions correctly despite version warning
- Consider updating for production builds

### Web Preview
- Mobile web preview (port 8081/8084) has compatibility issues
- This is expected - mobile functionality works perfectly on devices
- Use Expo Go for accurate mobile testing
